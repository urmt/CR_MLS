# ðŸ”§ GitHub Actions Permissions Fix

## Good News! ðŸŽ‰
Your scraper is **working perfectly**! The workflow successfully:
- âœ… Installed dependencies 
- âœ… Generated 19 new properties
- âœ… Moved them to active (48 total properties now)
- âœ… All scripts executed without errors

## Only Issue: Push Permissions ðŸ”’
The workflow can't push the generated properties back to GitHub due to permissions.

**Error:** `Permission to urmt/CR_MLS.git denied to github-actions[bot]`

## Fix: Update Workflow Permissions
Go to your GitHub repository and edit the workflow file:

**URL:** https://github.com/urmt/CR_MLS/edit/main/.github/workflows/autonomous-mls.yml

**Add this at the top of the file (after line 2):**

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write
  actions: read
```

So it looks like:
```yaml
name: Autonomous Costa Rica MLS

permissions:
  contents: write
  actions: read

on:
  schedule:
    # Run property scraping every 6 hours
    - cron: '0 */6 * * *'
    # etc...
```

## Alternative: Enable in Repository Settings
Or go to:
1. **Repository Settings** â†’ **Actions** â†’ **General**
2. Scroll to **Workflow permissions**  
3. Select **"Read and write permissions"**
4. Click **Save**

## After This Fix
Your autonomous system will be **fully operational**:
- âœ… Generate properties every 6 hours
- âœ… Automatically commit and push to GitHub  
- âœ… Properties appear on your website
- âœ… Weekly purging and email campaigns
- âœ… Complete automation!

The scraping logic is perfect - just needs push permissions!
