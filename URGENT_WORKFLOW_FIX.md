# ðŸš¨ URGENT WORKFLOW SYNTAX ERROR - IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED

## The Problem Found âœ…
I found the exact issue causing your workflow failures! In your GitHub workflow file, **line 42** has a **critical syntax error**.

**Current (BROKEN) line 42:**
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    https://github.com/urmt/CR_MLS/blob/main/.github/workflows/autonomous-mls.yml
```

This is trying to execute a GitHub URL as a shell command, which fails with "No such file or directory".

## IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED ðŸ”§

**Go to:** https://github.com/urmt/CR_MLS/edit/main/.github/workflows/autonomous-mls.yml

**Find line 42** which currently shows:
```
https://github.com/urmt/CR_MLS/blob/main/.github/workflows/autonomous-mls.yml
```

**Replace it with:**
```
npm ci --only=production || npm install --production
```

**Commit with message:** `ðŸš¨ Fix critical syntax error in workflow line 42`

## What Happened?
During the manual editing process, the npm install command got accidentally replaced with a GitHub URL. This is why the workflow has been failing with the "No such file or directory" error.

## After This Fix
Your workflow should work immediately! The error was just this one line. Once fixed:

1. Go to **Actions** tab 
2. Click **"Run workflow"** 
3. Select **"scrape"** and run it
4. It should now complete successfully!

This fix will restore your autonomous property generation system.
